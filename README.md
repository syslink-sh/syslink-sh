# Hello, I’m Syslink

This is my GitHub profile.

## About Me
I am a software developer with a broad interest in building practical and experimental solutions. Most of my projects are currently private by choice, as I prefer to iterate and refine internally before making them public. My work spans a variety of tools, web applications, and automation projects.

## What I Do
- Full-stack web development  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js  
- Discord bot development  
- Occasional security and penetration testing experiments  

## Projects
The majority of my projects are private at this time. Public repositories may be released in the future as they mature.
