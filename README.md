# hi, i'm syslink

yea this is my github profile

## about me
i code stuff sometimes. most of my projects are private cuz, idk, i just keep them that way. i build random tools, web apps, bots, whatever i feel like.

## what i do
- mainly full-stack web stuff  
- html, css, js, nodejs… the usual  
- discord bots cuz why not  
- sometimes security and pentest experiments 

## projects
most of them are private, so uh… you won't see much here. trust the process i guess, maybe i would make then public.

## contact
if you found this, cool. if you need something, just ask. i'm probably online all day.
